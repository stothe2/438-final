\section{Motivation}

Aging is a universal biological process; and is known to be a major risk factor in diseases like type-2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and more. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of aging are still not well understood. This leaves the question ``Is aging genetically programmed?'' open for debate. Studying the association between aging and gene expression might give us some insights which could lead to novel treatments for treating age-related diseases.

We propose to study aging -- gene expression association in humans [in subcutaneous adipose tissue and whole blood tissue], and its link to disease.

\section{Background}

The study is based on Yang, \emph{et al.} (2015). The major difference is that we have \emph{more} samples for the same tissues. As as a result, it'd be interesting to compare our results.

\section{Aims and Methods}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find age -- gene expression association and report it for top 100 genes for subcutaneous adipose tissue and whole blood tissue
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Use linear regression (correct for gender and top 3 genotype PCs, and ensure gene expression PCs have p-value $>0.05$), bootstrapping (remove 20\% low expressed genes), and permutation (estimate false positives).
	\end{itemize}
\item Functional annotation of aging genes [up- and down-regulated separately]
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Use David tools.
	\end{itemize}
\item Tissue specific link between aging genes and complex disease genes.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Disease gene data compiled from NIH GWAS and OHIM using clustering.
	\item Fisher's test for aging -- diseases genes link.
	\end{itemize}
\item Compare results with Yang, \emph{et al.} (2015).
\end{enumerate}


\section{Data}

Gene expression data is taken from GTEx project v6 (PC values for top 3 genotypes are available; labeled C1, C2, and C3 in figure 1).
